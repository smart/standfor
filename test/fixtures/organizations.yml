    \r\n\
    In pursuit of this vision, AI\xE2\x80\x99s mission is to undertake research and action focused on preventing and ending grave abuses of the rights to physical and mental integrity, freedom of conscience and expression, and freedom from discrimination, within the context of its work to promote all human rights.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    AI is independent of any government, political ideology, economic interest or religion.
