  <p> StandforUs has created a revolutionary new model for cause marketing where corporate sponsors inject their branding into the advocacy badges. We are inspired by the melding of for-profit financial might with non-profit moral might. Therefore, we are giving corporations the opportunity to brand alongside a non-profit cause. 85% of revenues generated by these sponsorships will go to the organizations where your brand appears, the rest will go to support the StandforUs infrastructure. If you are would like your brand associated with the organizations featured on StandforUs, give us a call and we will arrange for it. </p>
